Additionally, the excess androgens can also cause salt wasting, leading to low blood pressure (hypotension) and other symptoms.\n\nCAH is caused by mutations in the genes that encode for the enzymes involved in the production of cortisol and aldosterone. There are two main forms of CAH: classic and non-classic. Classic CAH is the most severe form and is caused by mutations in the gene for 21-hydroxylase, while non-classic CAH is caused by mutations in the genes for 11-beta-hydroxylase or 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.\n\nDiagnosis of CAH is typically made through blood tests that measure the levels of various hormones and their metabolites. Treatment typically involves replacement therapy with hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, as well as close monitoring by a pediatric endocrinologist.
